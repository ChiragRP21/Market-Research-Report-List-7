<p><p>Orthopedic reconstruction in knee and hip refers to surgical procedures aimed at restoring function and alleviating pain in damaged or diseased joints. These procedures often involve joint replacement, where damaged parts of the knee or hip are replaced with artificial implants made of metal, plastic, or ceramic. Common surgeries include total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA), which are highly effective for conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and traumatic injuries.</p><p>The Orthopedic Reconstruction in Knee & Hip Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by factors such as the rising prevalence of osteoarthritis and other degenerative joint diseases, an aging population, and advancements in implant materials and surgical techniques. Minimally invasive procedures, robotic-assisted surgeries, and personalized implants are among the latest trends shaping the market. Additionally, the increasing adoption of 3D printing for custom implants and the development of bioresorbable materials are further enhancing patient outcomes.</p><p>Geographically, North America and Europe dominate the market due to high healthcare spending and advanced medical infrastructure. However, the Asia-Pacific region is emerging as a significant growth area, fueled by improving healthcare access and rising awareness about joint reconstruction procedures. Overall, the market is poised for steady expansion, driven by technological innovation and increasing demand for improved quality of life among patients.</p></p>
