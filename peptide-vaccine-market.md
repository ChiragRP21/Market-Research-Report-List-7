<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peptide Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS)</li><li>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peptide vaccine market is influenced by two primary synthesis methods: Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS) and Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). SPS involves synthesizing peptides in a liquid solution, allowing for longer peptide chains but can be less efficient for complex peptides. In contrast, SPPS is a more widely used technique where peptides are assembled on a solid support, enabling efficient and rapid production of complex peptides with higher purity. Both methods are critical for advancing peptide-based therapeutics and vaccines.</p></p>
