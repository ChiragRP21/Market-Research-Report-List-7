<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor Chips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated</li><li>Backside-illuminated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS image sensor chips are categorized into front-illuminated and backside-illuminated types. Front-illuminated sensors have photodiodes located in front of the circuitry, limiting light exposure and resulting in lower image quality, especially in low light. In contrast, backside-illuminated sensors position the photodiodes behind the circuitry, enhancing light collection and yielding superior performance in low-light conditions. The market for these sensors is driven by applications in smartphones, cameras, and automotive systems, with an increasing demand for high-quality imaging solutions.</p></p>
